## Learned Patterns

### Workflows pushing to a shared branch need `concurrency:`

- **Context**: GHA workflows that push to a long-lived shared branch (`gh-pages`, deployment, release) from multiple jobs or via repeated `workflow_dispatch`.
- **Problem**: Parallel runs each fetch the branch, do work, then push — second pusher hits non-fast-forward rejection. Wasted compute scales with run length (we lost 48 min of commit generation).
- **Solution**: Declare a workflow-level concurrency group keyed by the shared branch.
- **Example**:

  ```yaml
  concurrency:
    group: gh-pages-paint
    cancel-in-progress: false
  ```text
