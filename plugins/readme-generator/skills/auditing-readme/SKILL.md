# Audit README

**Scope**: $ARGUMENTS

Audit README.md files against scope-specific best practices and report findings.

## Phase 1: Detect Scope and Targets

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `repo` — audit README.md in the current directory
- `repo <owner/repo>` — audit a specific remote repo's README
- `repos <owner/pattern>` — batch audit multiple repos (e.g., `repos qte77/gha-*`)
- `account <username>` — audit a GitHub user profile README
- `org <orgname>` — audit an organization profile README

## Phase 2: Fetch READMEs

- Local repos: read README.md directly
- Remote repos: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/README.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d`
- Account profiles: `gh api repos/<user>/<user>/contents/README.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d`
- Org profiles: try `profile/README.md` first, fall back to root `README.md` in `.github` repo

## Phase 3: Run Checklist

### Base Repo Checklist

### Organization Profile Checklist

| # | Check | Level | Pass Condition |
|---|-------|-------|----------------|

| O2 | Mission | required | Single-sentence purpose within 3 lines of H1 |
| O3 | Activities | required | Description of what the org does |
| O4 | Projects | recommended | Links to key repos, grouped by domain |
| O5 | CTA | required | "Get involved" section with actionable links |
| O6 | Length | recommended | 150-400 words |

## Phase 4: Report

Output a findings table per target:

```yaml
## <repo-name>

| # | Check | Level | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|--------|-------|

Summary: X/Y required pass, Z/W recommended pass.
```

### Batch Summary

```text
| Repo | Required | Recommended | Top Issue |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|
```

### Consistency Checks (batch only)

- Input table column order consistent?
- Badge style/placement consistent?
- Section naming consistent?
- License format consistent (`LICENSE` not `LICENSE.md`)?

## Rules

- Never modify files during an audit — read-only
- Report facts, not opinions
- License file MUST be `LICENSE` (not `LICENSE.md`) — flag as FAIL if `.md` variant used
