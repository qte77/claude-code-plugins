# Audit README

**Scope**: $ARGUMENTS

Audit README.md files against scope-specific best practices and report findings.

## Phase 1: Detect Scope and Targets

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `repo` — audit README.md in the current directory
- `repo <owner/repo>` — audit a specific remote repo's README
- `repos <owner/pattern>` — batch audit multiple repos (e.g., `repos qte77/gha-*`)
- `account <username>` — audit a GitHub user profile README
- `org <orgname>` — audit an organization profile README

## Workflow Mode (batch `repos` scope)

When scope is `repos` with **more than ~3 targets** and the **Workflow tool is available**,
fan the audit out in parallel instead of looping turn-by-turn:

1. Resolve the glob to a concrete list: `gh repo list <owner> --json nameWithOwner`, filtered by pattern.
2. Drive the bundled workflow (its instruction to call Workflow is the opt-in — no `ultracode` needed):

   ```
   Workflow({
     scriptPath: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflows/audit-repos.js",
     args: { repos: ["owner/a", "owner/b"],
             skillPath: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/auditing-readme/SKILL.md" }
   })
   ```

   `args` is delivered to the script as a JSON string (the script parses it). Alternatively pass
   `{ owner, pattern, skillPath }` and let the workflow's Discover phase resolve the list.
3. Render the returned `perRepo` findings and `consistency` observations with the Phase 4 format.

Fall back to the inline Phases 2–4 (one repo at a time) when the Workflow tool is unavailable.
The workflow's agents are **read-only**, so the only permission to pre-grant is the Workflow tool.

## Phase 2: Fetch READMEs

- Local repos: read README.md directly
- Remote repos: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/README.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d`
- Account profiles: `gh api repos/<user>/<user>/contents/README.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d`
- Org profiles: try `profile/README.md` first, fall back to root `README.md` in `.github` repo

## Phase 3: Run Checklist

### Base Repo Checklist — qte77 doc-structure canon

Derives from the [canon contract](https://github.com/qte77/qte77/blob/main/docs/doc-structure.md)
(SoT) — audit against it, never redefine it.

| # | Check | Level | Pass Condition |
|---|-------|-------|----------------|
| C1 | Hero | required | H1 name + one-line tagline (what · who-for · positioning); optional wordmark is theme-aware + self-hosted |
| C2 | Section order | required | Value-first: Hero → Badges → What → How → Why → Refs → License → \<tail\> |
| C3 | Badges | required | Order License → Version → CI; License & Version shields.io static `blue`; License label carries the SPDX id (e.g. `License: Apache-2.0`, not bare `license-MIT`); Version linked to `CHANGELOG.md`; status badges native color; left-aligned, no `<p align="center">` |
| C4 | What | required | `## What` present, ≤ ~7 reader-value bullets |
| C5 | How | required | `## How` minimal run example + link out to `docs/` |
| C6 | Why | required | `## Why` 2–4 lines (incumbent → gap → differentiation) |
| C7 | Refs | required | `## Refs` links only, no prose |
| C8 | License | required | `## License` SPDX id + link to `LICENSE` (not `LICENSE.md`) |
| C9 | Front-door | recommended | each section answers its one question; depth links out to `docs/`, not inlined |
| C10 | Screenshots | optional | if present: collapsed `<details>` at bottom of What, theme-aware, self-hosted at `assets/images/` |
| C11 | Links valid | required | all `[text](relative-path)` links resolve; LICENSE file named `LICENSE` (not `LICENSE.md`) |

### GHA Extension (if `action.yml`/`action.yaml` exists)

| # | Check | Level | Pass Condition |
|---|-------|-------|----------------|
| G1 | Inputs table | required | Markdown table under heading containing "input" |
| G2 | Outputs table | required | Markdown table or "no outputs" statement |
| G3 | Usage YAML | required | Fenced yaml block with `uses:` |
| G4 | What it does | required | Section with numbered steps |
| G5 | Input column order | recommended | Name, Required, Default, Description |

### Account Profile Checklist

| # | Check | Level | Pass Condition |
|---|-------|-------|----------------|
| A1 | Tagline | required | Non-empty text within 5 lines of first heading |
| A2 | Current focus | recommended | Section describing current work |
| A3 | Featured projects | recommended | 3+ repository links with descriptions |
| A4 | Not stale | required | Updated within 6 months |
| A5 | Scannability | recommended | Under 500 words |

### Organization Profile Checklist

| # | Check | Level | Pass Condition |
|---|-------|-------|----------------|
| O1 | File location | required | README at `.github/profile/README.md` |
| O2 | Mission | required | Single-sentence purpose within 3 lines of H1 |
| O3 | Activities | required | Description of what the org does |
| O4 | Projects | recommended | Links to key repos, grouped by domain |
| O5 | CTA | required | "Get involved" section with actionable links |
| O6 | Length | recommended | 150-400 words |

## Phase 4: Report

Output a findings table per target:

```
## <repo-name>

| # | Check | Level | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|--------|-------|

Summary: X/Y required pass, Z/W recommended pass.
```

### Batch Summary

```
| Repo | Required | Recommended | Top Issue |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|
```

### Consistency Checks (batch only)

- Section order matches the canon (Hero → Badges → What → How → Why → Refs → License → tail)?
- Badge order/colors consistent (License → Version → CI; static `blue` / native status)?
- Version badge linked to `CHANGELOG.md` (flag a bare `![Version](…)`)?
- Canon section names used (`## What` / `## How` / `## Why` / `## Refs`, not `## Resources`)?
- License format consistent (`LICENSE` not `LICENSE.md`)?

## Rules

- Never modify files during an audit — read-only
- Report facts, not opinions
- **Derive from the canon; never invent divergent structure** — qte77/qte77
  `docs/doc-structure.md` is authoritative
- License file MUST be `LICENSE` (not `LICENSE.md`) — flag as FAIL if `.md` variant used
