# Syncing a design snapshot into a repo

A repo can ship pages that a design tool owns: the design system holds the templates (`*.dc.html` plus shared
scripts), and the repo keeps a flat snapshot of them (e.g. `packages/<site>/public/`) with a short, reviewed list
of its own changes. This skill re-syncs that snapshot. It never writes to the design system.

## 1. Fetch the template (main session; the scripts do not fetch)

Where the design system lives decides the tool:

- **A Design System artifact** (`claude.ai/artifact/<id>`; files under `project/`). Systems migrated from the
  standalone tool, and new ones, are artifacts. List the files with the Artifact tool (`action: "list"`,
  `scope: "files"`, the artifact `url`); the listing names the current version, so note it. Read the page and
  the shared files it loads (`action: "read"`, `paths`, an `out_dir`), e.g. `project/templates/<page>/*` and
  `project/templates/_shared/<script>.js`. `DesignSync` cannot reach an artifact.
- **A standalone claude.ai/design project** (`claude.ai/design/p/<projectId>`). Use `DesignSync` `list_files`
  and `get_file`. `get_file` caps at 256 KiB and truncates silently. Standalone Claude Design closes on
  14 December 2026 (help-centre article "Migrate from standalone Claude Design to Claude"); after migration,
  edits made in Claude are not migrated back, so a migrated system must be read from its artifact.

Copy the text files flat into one directory (binary files such as photos stay in the snapshot; fetch them once).
Design systems can change several times a day: fetch right before syncing, and never reuse an earlier fetch.

## 2. Configure the patches

`scripts/sync_template.py` reads a project config with `TARGET_DIR` and `PATCHES`, a list of
`(file, original, replacement, why)` tuples (`replacement=None` deletes). Keep every patch listed with its reason
in the site's README, and send each design-side fix upstream so the patch can be dropped later.

For a deletion that removes content (a held claim, a link the site must not show, a stored-data call), add a fifth
element, a **guard**: a short phrase of that content. Without it, a design that only restyles the markup (say, a
font-family literal turned into a CSS variable) makes the exact original disappear, and the patch reports
"carried" while the content ships. With a guard, the patch counts as carried only once the guard phrase is gone
too; otherwise it fails for review. Pick a phrase that occurs nowhere else on the page.

## 3. Dry run, then sync

```sh
python3 scripts/sync_template.py <fetched-dir> <project-config.py> --dry-run
python3 scripts/sync_template.py <fetched-dir> <project-config.py>
```

Each patch is reported `applied`, `carried` (the template has it: drop the patch from the config and the README)
or `FAIL` (the original changed: review). Any `FAIL` writes nothing. A `carried` deletion without a guard deserves
a manual check that the content is really gone.

## 4. After the sync

- Diff the snapshot (`git diff --stat`): new shared files the page loads come in with it; drop any the page does
  not reference.
- Build and check the site locally at desktop and phone sizes before a PR, then deploy production only.
- Update the README's fetch date and source (artifact URL and version, or project), and the patch list.
